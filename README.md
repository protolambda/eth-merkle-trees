# Eth merkle trees

As part of the R&D for Eth 2.0 various ideas for merkle trees are documented/linked in this repo.

 * [Current SSZ Spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/simple-serialize.md) - describes the mechanics of SSZ merkleization
 * [SSZ Multiproofs Spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/light_client/merkle_proofs.md) - describes generalized indices and multiproofs
 * [New SSZ Spec](https://github.com/protolambda/eth2.0-ssz/) - WIP, includes more motivation and detail around the merkleization/proof side of SSZ
 * [Summary of SSZ Multiproof concepts / backings](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/pull/1400#issuecomment-534400064) - see "RE multi-proof structure:"
 * [SSZ Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT)](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1472) - discussion about adding SMTs to SSZ
 * [EE Multiproof Concerns](https://github.com/quilt/pm/issues/2) - great writeup on the expected EE toolchain
 * [Discussion on Requesting Multiproofs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/644)
 * [Discussion on SSZ Partials / Classic Proof Backing](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/1303)
 * [Turboproof Proof Backing](https://medium.com/@gballet/turboproofs-light-clients-and-saving-private-eth1-487aaa9b386)
 * [Tree-offset Proof Backing](./tree_offsets.md)
 * [Typing and Partials](./typing_partials.md)
